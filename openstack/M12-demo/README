= Distributed Crawler Demo =
============================

This distributed crawler demo demonstrates the fundamentals of Infinispan that are 
listeners, put/get operations and the atomic objects factory. 
The crawler is clustered and can offer 
some basic sentiment analysis features using the AlchemyAPI. 

In more details, the crawler implements most of LEADS Use Case 1:
 - the user provides a list of key words,
 - the crawler analyzes sentimentally web pages that match the words, and
 - in case the score is positive, they are stored permanently with their associated score.
The source code of the crawler is available in the GitHub repository at the 
following address http://github.com/otrack/Leads-crawler. 

=========
= USAGE =
=========

To launch an instance of the crawler, we execute {pcrawl,icrawl}.sh scripts.
Note that multiple instances can run on the same machine (vertical scalability), or inside the same cluster (horizontal scalability).
The script pcrawl.sh implements the permanent part of the crawl, and runs continuously to construct an off-line data collection.
Conversely, icrawl.sh returns the state of the result at the time of its invocation.
The different crawler instances communicate via Infinispan using a concurrent atomic list to store the next urls to crawl, 
and a concurrent map to store the results (see D1.2 for more details). 

=================
= CONFIGURATION =
================

The crawler is set-up via the config.properties file present at the root of the directory, as illustrated below.

seed=http://www.guardian.co.uk
infinispanConfigFile=infinispan-clustered-tcp.xml
words=UK
ncrawlers=1
sentimentAnalysisKeyFile=key.txt
depth=3

Parameter seed defines the first URL to crawl, words contains the list of words to search for, 
integer ncrawlers defines the number of (local) concurrent threads that will crawl and key.txt defines the file 
that contains the AlchemyAPI key to use (provided in the archive).
Parameter depth configures the depth of the crawl, that is the length of the longest path in the crawling tree.
